# Interest-Calculator

## Description
A Java program that gives the user options to see the effect of compound interest on their investments in different scenarios such as a savings with monthly contributions and a fixed APR or calculating the monthly payment of a fixed loan over a set time period.

## Functionality
Via a multitude of different mathematical calculations and by allowing the user to specify which calculator they'd like to use, my program will take various inputs from the user and provide them with a result of their investment/loan.

## Usage
By simply downloading the program, compiling, and running, one would have access to four different calculators that could help provide insight into different financial investments. To compare the accuracy to already existing calculators, one could select my "Savings w/ Monthly Contributions" calculator and input the same values into [investor.gov's](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator) compound interest calculator, then compare the results!
